# AirSim Demo

## Goal
This AirSim Demo is mean to be a simple demonstration of the desired capabilities for our project. It shows that we can obtain a live video feed from the AirSim Environment and perform Visual Question Answering using a Transformer model

## Notes
Place the settings.json file into the directory containing the Microsoft AirSim executable file. This file is used specifically to alter settings about the 
AirSim, such as the resolution of images used for our model.

See https://microsoft.github.io/AirSim/image_apis/ for information about the settings and camera parameters
